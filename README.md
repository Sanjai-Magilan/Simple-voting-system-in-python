This is my first project when I learned coding for the first time. I wrote this with the knowledge I had when I was a newbie, but now I'm going to update the project with the programming skills I have. It brings back the memories of the initial days when my friend and I were learning the new topics from the textbook before the teacher taught us. I hope that I will use my current knowledge for the project and learn new things in this development journey.
